    <h1>Notes from the Fox Holes</h1>
    <p class="page1">Hello Dearest<br><br>I hope these days find you safe and healthy. I understand it may be hard right now to hold on to sanity,<br>
    but I hope you are doing your best to hang on to whatever shreds of mind you have left.<br><br>These are interesting days for us here on the front lines<br>
    they shuttered the mess halls long ago<br>We've been having to ration the food we were able to squirrel away before the barracks were deemed<br>
    no longer fit for occupancy.<br>As a result, they have forced us all into individual lodging with ample distance between each party<br><br>
    I pray the tide of this war turns swiftly, I am no longer certain I have the stomach to face the looming crisis.</p>
    <p class="page2">An eerie calm rests upon us all here exposed while sheltered as we find ourselves<br>Just yesterday morn I awoke to find all the birds had forgotten<br>
    they were supposed to herald the dawn, it made for a difficult rousing of one's bones.<br><br>It seems there has been a brief truce for I cannot 
    recall the last time we engaged in open warfare.<br>I hope it lasts longer than the previous battle, my bones are weary of fighting.<br>
    I regret I must cut this missive short, the rationing has been extended to paper<br>and this one my have to adapt its use before more supply arrives<br><br>
    All my Love<br>Nick Long<br>Pvt. 2nd Class</p>
